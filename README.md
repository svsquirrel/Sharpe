# Sharpe
This is the initial attempt to determine the Sharpe ratio using Python. Future edits will be to make it for a rolling period. Ultimate 
goal is to make a user interface where a person can select 2 ETF's and calculate the Sharpe ratio for a combination of portfolio  
allotments.  I want the investor to be able to  determine what mix of ETF's has the best Sharpe ratio so the portfolio can be adjusted
accordingly.
